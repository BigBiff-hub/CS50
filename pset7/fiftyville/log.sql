--Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, 
--I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.

--I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. 
--Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, 
--I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

--As the thief was leaving the courthouse, 
--they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. 
--In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest 
--flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other
--end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket
