        <h3>What is Solidity? </h3>
        
        <p>
            Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.
            It is used for implementing smart contracts
            on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.
            It was developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, and several former Ethereum core 
            contributors to enable writing smart contracts on 
            blockchain platforms such as Ethereum.
            The programs compiled by the Solidity are intended to be run on Ethereum Virtual Machine

         Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, also known as EVM.
        
        As specified by Wood it is designed around the ECMAScript syntax to make it familiar for existing web developers
        unlike ECMAScript it has static typing and variadic return types. Compared to other EVM-targeting languages of the time such as Serpent and Mutan, 
        Solidity contained a number of important differences. Complex member variables for contracts including arbitrarily hierarchical 
        mappings and structs were supported. 
        Contracts support inheritance, including multiple inheritance with C3 linearization.
